          You have successfully covered the unit test for the age estimator! üéâ
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Unit Test</strong>: A unit test is a type of software test that focuses on verifying individual components or functions of an application. The goal is to ensure that each part of the software performs as expected, independently of the rest of the system. In this case, the unit test ensures that the age estimator calculates age correctly within the application.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Test Scenario (TS)</strong>: A test scenario provides a high-level description of what needs to be tested, focusing on overall functionality and behavior. It is adaptable and used as a starting point for identifying specific test cases.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Test Case (TC)</strong>: A test case is a detailed step-by-step process used to verify that specific features of the application work as expected. It includes inputs, actions, and the expected results for each test. In this case, you will need to write the bug report for TC013.
          <br /><br />
          üìù Now, you can write a bug report describing TC013.
